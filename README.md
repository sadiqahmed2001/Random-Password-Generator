# Random-Password-Generator
This Python function creates a random password of a specified length using a combination of capital letters, lowercase letters, numerals, and punctuation characters.  

Import statements:
Import random: This module contains utilities for generating random numbers.
import string: This imports the string module, which includes several string constants and helpful functions.

Variable Initialization:
pass_len = 12: Determines the length of the password to be produced. In this scenario, the password length is set to twelve characters.
charvalue = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation: Combines three strings from the string module.
string.ascii_letters: Lists all ASCII letters, including uppercase and lowercase.
string.digits: Contains the digit characters '0' through '9'.
string.punctuation: Includes all punctuation characters.

Create the Password:
password = "": Creates an empty string for storing the produced password.
The function then enters a loop, generating the password character by character.
Each iteration of the loop (for i in range(pass_len)) adds a random character from charvalue to the password string.
After the loop is finished, the password string contains the randomly generated password.

Printing the Password:
Print("Your random password is: ", password) Prints the created password.

Alternative Method (Commented Out):
A commented-out line (# list comprehension password = "".join([random.choice(charvalue) for i in range(pass_len)])) does the same function using list comprehension. It generates a list of randomly selected characters from charvalue and then combines them to produce the password.
It generates a list of random characters from charvalue and then connects them to construct the password.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward method for creating random passwords of a specific length using a variety of character kinds.
THE CODE:----
# import random

# import string

# pass_len=12
# charvalue=string.ascii_letters+string.digits+string.punctuation

# password=""
# for i in range(pass_len):
#     password += random.choice(charvalue)

# #list comprehension password="".join([random.choice(charvalue) for i in range(pass_len)])
# #print(res)
# print("your random password is: ", password)
